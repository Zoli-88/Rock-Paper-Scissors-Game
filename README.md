# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a simple game I created by using HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript as my first project.

## How the game works

The user can click on one out of three possible options (Rock, Paper or Scissors). The computer then chooses one option at random as a response.

Game rules: Rock beats Scissors. Paper beats Rock. Scissors beats Paper. If both the user's and the computer's choices are the same, we have a draw.

Player wins, computer wins and draws are shown on screen. The user can also reset the score.
